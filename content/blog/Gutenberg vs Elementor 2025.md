## Gutenberg vs. Elementor which one is better for WordPress CMS in 2025 ?
If you need to use WordPress, Gutenberg is the safe way. But if you want to use a webflow like builder then just go for Elementor.
[Sandbox Gutenberg Environment](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/)

### Pros of Gutenberg

* **Core WordPress Integration:** Gutenberg is deeply integrated into WordPress, ensuring compatibility with future updates.
* **Performance:** It's lightweight and contributes to faster website loading times.
* **Future-Proof:** WordPress team is actively developing Gutenberg, adding new features and improvements.
* **Free and Open Source:** Gutenberg is completely free and open source, allowing for community contributions and customization.
* **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility standards in mind.

### Cons of Gutenberg

* **Limited Design Options:** Compared to dedicated page builders, Gutenberg offers fewer advanced design options.
* **Learning Curve:** The block-based editing system may require some time to learn for new users.
* **Need for Plugins:** Complex designs or functionalities might require additional plugins.

### Pros of Elementor

* **Most of it Free:** Elementor provides a free version and you wont feel difference if you dont care about form and some animation features.
* **Advanced Design Capabilities:** Elementor provides a drag-and-drop interface and a wide range of widgets for creating visually appealing pages.

* **Extensive Plugin and Theme Support:** Elementor has a large ecosystem of add-ons and themes, expanding its functionality.
* **Live Preview:** Users can see changes in real-time.
* **Template Library:** Offers many pre-made templates.

### Cons of Elementor

* **Performance Issues:** Elementor can impact website performance, especially with complex pages.
* **Paid Version Required:** Advanced features are only available in the paid Pro version.
* **Code Bloat:** Elementor can generate excessive code, affecting SEO and performance.
* **Plugin Conflicts:** Compatibility issues may arise with certain plugins.

## Why not other Page Builders like Oxygen, Divi or Bricks?
If you want to get lost you can try more of those builders.

I dont recommend most of them.
Oxygen is pure performance but depends on so many other addons.
Divi is way more bloated than Elementor. But has great marketing and support team.
Bricks uses Vue.js 3 framework (inside the builder). Has great features just like Elementor.
And they claim that you can convert Gutenberg blocks to Bricks content or vice versa.
That is a promising builder. You can try it but it has no free version.
On the other hand Elementor has been supported so many addon plugin developers, means Elementor has an ecosystem in the WordPress world.
