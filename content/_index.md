## About Yasin

{{< faq >}}

  {{< faq-item title="Frontend Oriented Fullstack WordPress Developer?" >}}
  Fullstack WordPress Developer (Frontend-Oriented) with 8 years of expertise in WordPress development.
  Specialized in Web development, SEO, SEM, and e-commerce solutions.
  My expertise lies in frontend development and technical design, but I am also capable of managing end-to-end web projects. Just like any developer should do, I find or create the necessary solution for any web project.
  {{< /faq-item >}}

  {{< faq-item title="Technical Support Yasin?" >}}
  Back in times when I was working in my local area, I worked as a support guy for a brief period. I switched to customer support roles that required less cognitive load. Working remotely allows an easy transition between roles.
  I also have hands-on experience with setting up physical servers, client devices, and access points for restaurant automation systems.
  {{< /faq-item >}}

  {{< faq-item title="Professional Background" >}}
  First 4 years of my career were at a local software agency in my city. Here I gained experience in various fields. Later, I worked as a freelancer for a while and finally met with UXly Software, a company providing services specifically for Silicon Valley startups. This experience boosted my confidence in handling global projects.
  In the meantime, I served long and short-term services for other businesses and completed numerous freelance projects for individual clients.

  {{< faq-item title="Why Choose Yasin?" >}}

  1. If you're looking for a WordPress expert, congratulations—you've found the right person.
  2. If design and aesthetics are your top priorities, I can ensure your project stands out.
  3. If you need a WordPress developer who can adapt to future transitions and evolving project requirements, I am the right fit.
  4. If you’re looking for a developer who focuses on solving problems rather than just building projects, you’re in the right place.
  5. If you’ve built an MVP with AI and need a traditional developer to maintain and improve it, I’m here to help (and yes, I use AI tools too).
  6. If you have a promising startup idea with investment potential and are offering equity along with minimal compensation, let’s talk.
  7. If you need to optimize your WordPress project like server or cloud performance, yes, you've found the guy for that.
  8. I'm different from much of the WP Developers because I also build website projects. I use those no-code/low-code tools, I mess with people, rip the necessary info from their mouths if I have to, and build their projects using different methods from different products/developers. I'm not some guru, but I can guide you to success.
