## About
With over 8 years of experience in web development, I specialize in creating high-performance digital solutions that drive business growth. My journey in tech has taken me from local projects in Turkey to collaborating with Silicon Valley startups, giving me a unique perspective on both emerging markets and global tech trends.
### Professional Journey
My career began with a foundation in Computer Aided Design and Animation, which gave me an eye for detail and user experience that proved invaluable in web development. While pursuing my Business Administration degree, I started working with local businesses, helping them establish their digital presence. This combination of technical skills and business acumen has been crucial in understanding not just how to build websites, but how to create digital solutions that deliver real business value.
As a Full Stack WordPress Developer, I've had the privilege of working on projects ranging from small business websites to enterprise-level applications. My experience includes leading a significant Silicon Valley project where we achieved a 30% reduction in bounce rates and 25% faster page load times. I'm particularly proud of my work integrating modern development tools like Timber template engine with WordPress, which improved development efficiency by 70% while reducing maintenance costs.
### Technical Philosophy
I believe in building websites that are not just visually appealing but also technically robust. My approach combines:

Performance-first development methodology
Secure and scalable architecture
User-centered design principles
SEO-optimized structure from the ground up

### Areas of Expertise
My technical toolkit includes deep expertise in WordPress development, complemented by proficiency in:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, React
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL, REST APIs
- **DevOps**: Git, Linux, AWS/Google Cloud
- **E-commerce**: WooCommerce, Shopify
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD
- **Performance Optimization & Security**: Cisco Certification

### Current Focus
Currently pursuing a Master's in Management Information Systems, I'm expanding my knowledge in enterprise-level system architecture and modern development methodologies. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of traditional CMS platforms with modern development practices, exploring ways to bring enterprise-level performance to WordPress-based solutions.
Beyond Development
When I'm not coding, I'm actively involved in staying current with web development trends and best practices. I believe in continuous learning and regularly experiment with new technologies and methodologies to enhance my development toolkit.
### Looking Forward
I'm always open to challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with WordPress and modern web technologies. Whether it's optimizing performance, implementing complex integrations, or building custom solutions, I bring a combination of technical expertise and business understanding to every project.
