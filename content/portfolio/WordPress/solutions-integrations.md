Here I will list variety of solutions I've created.

    (it loads the data to a visual responsive html table with live ajax request on page load)
- Built a multi vendor Zomato like restaurant listing website
- Integrated XML/CSV product lists to automatically update prodcuts on woocommerce with cron jobs.
- Integrated Timber.twig template engine with Elementor
- Integrated Taxi.js with Elementor
- Edited so many themes and plugins to achive custom functionality.
